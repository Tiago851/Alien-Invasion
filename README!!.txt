Hi,

This is the project that spans Chapters 12, 13 and 14 from the book: Python Crash Course, A Hands-on, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes

The objective here was to code along and understand/study the module Pygame which I've been learning for the 1st time.

This project was the most complex I've made as of February 2021 and it helped me immensely by showing me a different module as well as practising OOP which
has been the toughest part to understand in Python programming.

Cheers,

Tiago
